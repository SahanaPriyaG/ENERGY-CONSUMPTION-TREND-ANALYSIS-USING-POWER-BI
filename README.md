# ENERGY-CONSUMPTION-TREND-ANALYSIS-USING-POWER-BI
As part of my recent project, I leveraged Power BI to analyze and visualize energy consumption trends for water, electricity, and gas across various buildings. My major duties included data transformation, cleaning, and building dynamic relationships between multiple datasets. I created an interactive dashboard with detailed charts and slicers, which allowed stakeholders to compare energy usage, identify peak consumption periods, and calculate total energy costs.

One of the key highlights of the project was simplifying the data structure by unpivoting columns and transforming the data for easier analysis. I also implemented DAX measures to calculate total costs and consumption, helping identify inefficiencies and potential savings. The project not only improved the overall energy consumption monitoring process but also provided actionable insights for decision-makers to optimize resources effectively.

The success of this project lies in the ability to provide clear and actionable insights through intuitive visualizations, helping organizations make data-driven decisions to reduce energy costs and improve efficiency.
